## *Forever* blogging platforms

It has become quite difficult to find a reliable and sustainable blogging platform. Posterous has been [shut down by Twitter](http://www.posterous.com/) in April 2013 and Google reader has been [discontinued by Google](http://www.google.com/reader/about/) in July 2013 (which in my opinion let people think that you can only read content on social networks), not to mention Yahoo!'s habit to shut down [everything they buy](http://bgr.com/2014/03/07/yahoo-shutting-down-startups/) (which threatens Tumblr in the long run). 

Online blogging platform have suffered from these recent events, and people are now trying to find alternate solutions that can't be shut down by FYGT (Facebook/Yahoo/Google/Twitter). This is why the word *forever* is now the number one keyword for blogging platform marketing. *Forever* means either [install it yourself](https://ghost.org/pricing/) like in the old days, or [pay 5 dollars per month](https://posthaven.com/). 

##Enter Jekyll

One of the remaining alternatives are github pages powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is an amazing CMS because it is simple in its conception and does not have a back-office since you can only create static pages. Static pages are just files. Not relying on a back-office is an excellent benefit against time erosion. It will never make you feel like you are using a 5 year old CMS (tumblr interface is ugly). However, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) does have powerfull posting features. Just just need to create a new file in the `_post` directory and once deployed it is going to make a new article, available in your homepage and in the generated RSS feed.

##Sure, Jekyll has been made for developers

The main *disadvantage* of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is that it relies on you creating new files in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) file system to create new posts. Part of the buzz around Jekyll amongst developers is that they can `git push` a new article and write it using their favorite text editor.

##Using Jekyll with 0 programming tools
 
It turns out you can use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) without using git or anything like that. The only thing you need are:
- A (free) [Github account](https://github.com/join)
- A Jekyll website running on github pages. Technically this can be done by forking someone else's Jekyll site on github, which is no more complex than choosing a theme in tumblr (to fork a repo follow step 1 of [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))

Of course, having some knowledge html/css/javascript could help, but it is not fully mandatory. Anyway, many blogs are actually bootstraped by developers but content is managed by non technical people

Once you have your Jekyll website hosted on github pages, you can create articles, write content, upload pictures
